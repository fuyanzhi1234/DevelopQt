# Qt Resumable Download and Upload Plugin Demo

This is example how to use [Qt Download Plugin](https://github.com/arifsetiawan/qt-download-plugin) and [Qt Upload Plugin](https://github.com/arifsetiawan/qt-upload-plugin)

Application is functional for both download an upload but lack stop, pause and resume implementation. This should be easily implemented. Use both [download interface](https://github.com/arifsetiawan/qt-download-plugin/blob/master/downloadinterface.h) and [upload interface](https://github.com/arifsetiawan/qt-upload-plugin/blob/master/uploadinterface.h) as reference.

Also this example do not persist download and upload queue.

Note that currently only [tus](http://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html)  upload is implemented and tested.
